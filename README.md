# wso2-secure-vault-configuration

Create WSO2 Secure Vault configuration

This repository contains a perl script that simplifies the use of [WSO2's Secure Vault](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Carbon440/Securing+Passwords+in+Configuration+Files) feature.

The script scans the configuration files of a WSO2 product for plain text passwords and generates
the configuration files

    cipher-text.properties
    cipher-tool.properties

from the collected information.


## Prerequisites

    - perl 5.008 and newer
    - perl modules :

    - Carp
    - File::Basename
    - File::Find
    - File::Spec
    - Getopt::Long
    - Getopt::Std
    - IO::File
    - Time::HiRes
    - XML::Parser
    - XML::SAX::ParserFactory
    - XML::Simple
 
## Tested with WSO2 API Manager 

    - version 1.10

## Tested on 

    - Fedora 22, 24, 25
    - Centos7
    - Cygwin 


## Usage

    wso2ciphertoolconfig.pl [-dhvx] <carbonhome>"

        -d      debug
        -h      print usage and exit
        -v      be verbose
        -x      list available SAX parsers and exit
                (this is for debugging only)

## Getting Started

Install the scripts and the prerequisite perl modules, then execute the script as

    [axel@fc25 bin]$ ./wso2ciphertoolconfig.pl -v /opt/wso2/wso2am-1.10

Adapt the <carbonhome> location to your installation.

    Found 28 passwords in 11 out of 45 files.
    Created output files :
    /opt/wso2/wso2am-1.10/repository/conf/security/cipher-tool.properties
    /opt/wso2/wso2am-1.10/repository/conf/security/cipher-text.properties


Now you can run WSO2's ciphertool.sh script (that comes with the product) to go over the configuration files 
and encrypt the plaintext passwords in the configuration files :

    [axel@fc25 bin]$ export CARBON_HOME=/mnt/ssd/wso2/site1/wso2am_keymanager
    [axel@fc25 bin]$ export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_60
    [axel@fc25 bin]$ export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    [axel@fc25 bin]$ ${CARBON_HOME}/bin/ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure -Dpassword=wso2carbon


The 'wso2runjavaciphertool.sh' from the repository wraps this into a single command. 
It also takes care of a [pending issue in WSO2 API Manager 1.10](https://wso2.org/jira/browse/IDENTITY-4276).
(If the password is not provided on the command line with the '-p' option, the tool will prompt for it interactively).
    
    [axel@fc25 bin]$ ./wso2runjavaciphertool.sh -p wso2carbon /opt/wso2/wso2am-1.10

## Starting the API Manager with encrypted passwords

After [creating a temporary password file](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Carbon440/Resolving+Encrypted+Passwords)

    <CARBON_HOME>/password-tmp

with the password for the carbon keystore you can now start the API Manager.


## Known Bugs

The perl script throws a warning when parsing user-mgt.xml. 

    Warning: <Property> element has non-unique value in 'name' key attribute: MaxUserNameListLength at ./wso2ciphertoolconfig.pl line 333.

This can be ignored since the warning is correct. 
('<Property name="MaxUserNameListLength">100</Property>' is defined twice in user-mgt.xml).
